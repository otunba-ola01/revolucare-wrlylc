## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

Revolucare employs a modern cloud-native architecture based on a microservices-inspired approach with a monolithic deployment model. This hybrid architecture provides the conceptual separation of microservices while maintaining the deployment simplicity of a monolith, which is appropriate for the MVP phase.

**Architectural Style and Rationale:**
- **Next.js Full-Stack Application**: Utilizing Next.js for both frontend and backend provides a unified development experience while enabling server-side rendering for performance and SEO benefits.
- **API-First Design**: All functionality is exposed through well-defined API endpoints, enabling future expansion to native mobile applications.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: The system is organized around business domains (users, care plans, services, providers) rather than technical concerns.
- **Event-Driven Components**: Critical workflows like document processing and availability updates use event-driven patterns for resilience and scalability.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data access layers.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with enhanced experiences for modern browsers.
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect sensitive healthcare data.
- **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional with reduced capabilities when external services are unavailable.
- **Observability by Design**: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing built into the architecture.

**System Boundaries and Interfaces:**
- **Client Boundary**: Browser and mobile web applications interact with the system through the Next.js frontend.
- **API Boundary**: External systems integrate through the REST API layer.
- **External Service Boundary**: The system connects to third-party services (AI, payment processing, etc.) through dedicated integration layers.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Next.js Frontend | Deliver responsive UI for all user roles | React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui | Accessibility, performance, progressive enhancement |
| API Gateway | Route and validate API requests | Next.js API routes, authentication service | Rate limiting, request validation, error handling |
| Authentication Service | Manage user identity and access | NextAuth.js, database | Security, token management, session handling |
| User Service | Handle user profiles and preferences | Database, document storage | Privacy, data validation, profile completeness |
| Care Plan Service | Generate and manage care plans | AI service, document service | Medical data accuracy, version control, compliance |
| Services Plan Service | Create and track service plans | Provider service, payment service | Service matching accuracy, cost calculation, funding rules |
| Provider Service | Manage provider profiles and availability | Calendar service, notification service | Real-time updates, scheduling conflicts, provider matching |
| Analytics Service | Generate insights and reports | Database, caching layer | Data aggregation, performance, visualization |
| Document Service | Process and analyze documents | AI service, blob storage | Format handling, extraction accuracy, processing queue |
| Notification Service | Deliver alerts and messages | Email service, SMS service | Delivery guarantees, template management, preferences |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The Revolucare platform's data flows are organized around key user journeys and business processes:

**Authentication and Profile Management:**
Data begins with user registration, flowing through the authentication service for validation and secure storage. Profile data is collected incrementally and stored in the user service, with document uploads processed asynchronously through the document service. Profile completeness metrics flow to the analytics service.

**Care Plan Generation:**
Client medical data flows from document uploads to the document service, which coordinates with AI services for analysis. Extracted information flows to the care plan service, which generates plan options. These options flow to users for review, with feedback looping back for refinement. Finalized care plans flow to the services plan service for implementation.

**Provider Matching:**
Client needs data flows from care plans to the provider service, which applies matching algorithms against provider profiles. Availability data is continuously updated through calendar integrations. Match results flow to users for selection, with booking requests flowing back to providers for confirmation. Booking data flows to notification services for alerts and to analytics for reporting.

**Service Delivery and Tracking:**
Service status updates flow from providers to clients through the notification service. Outcome data flows to the analytics service for performance tracking. Payment information flows through the payment service with confirmation events triggering status updates.

**Key Data Stores:**
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary persistent storage for all structured data
- **Blob Storage**: Document repository for medical records and generated plans
- **Redis Cache**: Performance optimization for frequently accessed data like provider availability and service catalogs

**Data Transformation Points:**
- Document processing pipeline (raw documents → structured medical data)
- Care plan generation (medical data → personalized care plans)
- Provider matching (client needs → ranked provider recommendations)
- Analytics processing (raw events → aggregated insights)

### 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overall Architecture | Microservices-inspired Monolith | Pure Microservices, Traditional Monolith | Balances separation of concerns with deployment simplicity for MVP phase; enables future migration to true microservices |
| Frontend Architecture | Next.js with App Router | SPA with React Router, Traditional SSR | Provides optimal mix of SEO benefits, performance, and developer experience; server components reduce client-side JavaScript |
| API Design | RESTful with Resource-Oriented Design | GraphQL, RPC | Familiar pattern with broad tooling support; simpler implementation for MVP while maintaining flexibility |
| State Management | React Query + Context API | Redux, MobX, Zustand | Combines efficient server state management with lightweight UI state; reduces boilerplate while maintaining performance |

**Key Architecture Tradeoffs:**

The architecture prioritizes developer productivity and time-to-market for the MVP while establishing patterns that will support future scaling. The monolithic deployment model simplifies DevOps requirements but introduces some coupling between services. This tradeoff is acceptable for the initial release but will require refactoring as the system grows.

The decision to use Next.js for both frontend and backend creates a unified development experience but ties the scaling characteristics of these components together. This limitation is mitigated by the ability to extract API routes into separate services as needed.

#### 5.3.2 Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Use Cases | Benefits | Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synchronous Request-Response | User-initiated actions, UI data loading | Immediate feedback, Simplicity | Potential for cascading failures, Limited scalability |
| Asynchronous Processing | Document analysis, Report generation | Background processing, Resilience | Complexity in tracking status, Additional infrastructure |
| Event-Driven | Availability updates, Notifications | Loose coupling, Real-time updates | Event consistency challenges, Debugging complexity |
| Publish-Subscribe | Multi-recipient notifications, Analytics | Scalable distribution, Decoupling | Message delivery guarantees, Ordering challenges |

**Communication Pattern Rationale:**

The system employs multiple communication patterns based on the specific requirements of each interaction:

- **Synchronous patterns** are used for user-facing operations where immediate feedback is essential, such as authentication and basic CRUD operations.
- **Asynchronous processing** is employed for computationally intensive operations like document analysis and care plan generation, allowing the system to remain responsive.
- **Event-driven patterns** enable real-time updates for availability changes and booking confirmations, ensuring all components have current information.
- **Publish-subscribe** facilitates notifications to multiple interested parties, such as alerting both clients and providers about booking changes.

This mixed approach balances responsiveness, scalability, and system resilience while managing complexity.

#### 5.3.3 Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Selected Solution | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Relational Data | PostgreSQL | MySQL, SQL Server | Strong consistency guarantees, Advanced features (JSON, full-text search), Open-source with enterprise support |
| Document Storage | Vercel Blob Storage | S3, Azure Blob Storage | Seamless integration with Next.js, Simplified deployment, Adequate performance for MVP needs |
| Caching | Redis | Memcached, In-memory cache | Versatility (caching, pub/sub, rate limiting), Data structures support, Widespread adoption |
| Search | PostgreSQL Full-Text Search | Elasticsearch, Algolia | Simplifies infrastructure for MVP, Adequate for initial search needs, Integrated with primary database |

**Data Storage Considerations:**

The data storage strategy prioritizes simplicity and integration while ensuring adequate performance and scalability for the MVP phase:

- PostgreSQL provides a solid foundation for structured data with strong consistency guarantees, which are essential for healthcare information.
- Vercel Blob Storage simplifies the infrastructure stack while providing adequate performance for document storage needs.
- Redis offers versatility beyond simple caching, supporting multiple system needs with a single technology.
- Using PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search capabilities avoids introducing additional infrastructure components while meeting initial search requirements.

As the system scales, specialized services like Elasticsearch may be introduced for advanced search capabilities, and the document storage strategy may evolve to include more sophisticated content management features.

#### 5.3.4 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Use Cases | Invalidation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Cache | Redis | Provider directory, Service catalog, User profiles | Time-based expiration + explicit invalidation on updates |
| API Response Cache | Redis | Search results, Analytics dashboards | Time-based expiration with varying TTLs based on data volatility |
| Session Cache | Redis | Authentication sessions, User preferences | Token-based expiration + explicit logout invalidation |
| Static Asset Cache | CDN | Images, CSS, JavaScript | Cache-Control headers with long TTLs + versioned file names |

**Caching Strategy Rationale:**

The caching strategy is designed to balance performance improvements with data freshness requirements:

- Frequently accessed, relatively static data like provider directories and service catalogs are cached with longer TTLs to reduce database load.
- Search results and analytics dashboards are cached with shorter TTLs to balance performance with data freshness.
- Authentication sessions use token-based expiration with explicit invalidation on logout for security.
- Static assets are cached aggressively with versioned file names to ensure updates are immediately available.

This multi-layered approach ensures optimal performance while maintaining data integrity and security. Cache invalidation is handled through a combination of time-based expiration and explicit invalidation events triggered by data updates.

#### 5.3.5 Security Mechanism Selection

| Security Concern | Selected Mechanism | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | JWT with HTTP-only cookies | Session-based, OAuth-only | Stateless scalability with protection against XSS, Support for multiple auth providers |
| Authorization | Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions | Simple role-based, Attribute-based | Balances security granularity with implementation complexity, Supports complex healthcare access patterns |
| Data Protection | End-to-end encryption for sensitive data | Database-level encryption only | Protects data throughout its lifecycle, Complies with healthcare regulations |
| API Security | Rate limiting, CORS, CSP | API keys only | Defense in depth approach, Protection against common attack vectors |

**Security Architecture Decisions:**

The security architecture implements defense in depth with multiple layers of protection:

- Authentication combines the scalability benefits of JWTs with the security of HTTP-only cookies to prevent token theft via XSS.
- Authorization uses a role-based model with fine-grained permissions to support complex access patterns in healthcare scenarios.
- Sensitive data is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring protection throughout its lifecycle from client to storage and back.
- API security includes rate limiting to prevent abuse, CORS to control access, and Content Security Policy to mitigate injection attacks.

These mechanisms work together to provide comprehensive security while maintaining system performance and usability.

| API Performance | Custom middleware, Vercel Analytics | Response time, Error rate, Request volume | Response time > 500ms, Error rate > 1% |
| Database Performance | PostgreSQL metrics, Connection pooling | Query time, Connection count, Cache hit ratio | Query time > 100ms, Connections > 80% |
| Business Health | Custom analytics | User engagement, Conversion rates, Matching success | Daily active users -20%, Conversion rate -15% |

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

The logging and tracing strategy ensures comprehensive visibility into system behavior while managing storage and performance impacts:

**Logging Approach:**
- **Structured JSON Logs**: All logs use a consistent JSON format for machine parseability.
- **Contextual Information**: Each log includes user context, request IDs, and relevant business entities.
- **Log Levels**: Appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) are used to control verbosity.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: PII and PHI are automatically redacted from logs.

**Tracing Implementation:**
- **Correlation IDs**: Unique identifiers flow through all system components for request tracking.
- **Span Collection**: Key operations are wrapped in spans to measure duration and relationships.
- **Service Maps**: Automatically generated visualizations show system dependencies and bottlenecks.
- **Sampling Strategy**: Production uses adaptive sampling to balance visibility with performance.

| Log Category | Purpose | Retention Period | Sampling Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security Logs | Authentication, authorization, and security events | 1 year | 100% |
| Application Logs | System behavior and business events | 30 days | 100% |

| `document.analyzed` | Document Service | Care Plan Service | `{ documentId, clientId, analysisResults, timestamp }` | Trigger care plan generation |

**Event Bus Implementation**

The event-driven integration is implemented using a combination of:

1. **In-process events** for synchronous, same-service communication
2. **Redis Pub/Sub** for real-time, cross-service communication
3. **Persistent event log** for reliable event processing and replay

**Event Handling Patterns**

- **Publisher-Subscriber**: Services publish events to topics, and subscribers receive events they're interested in
- **Event Sourcing**: Critical business events are stored in an append-only log for audit and replay
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate write and read operations for complex domains

**Reliability Considerations**

- **At-least-once delivery**: Events are retried until successful processing
- **Idempotent handlers**: Event handlers are designed to safely process duplicate events
- **Dead letter queues**: Failed events are moved to a separate queue for investigation
- **Event versioning**: Event schemas include version information for backward compatibility

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

While Revolucare is initially implemented as a monolithic application for the MVP phase, it is designed with a service-oriented architecture internally to facilitate future evolution into a true microservices architecture. This approach provides the benefits of logical service separation while maintaining deployment simplicity.

### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibilities | Key Dependencies | Data Ownership |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication Service | User authentication, authorization, session management | User Service, Redis Cache | User credentials, tokens, sessions |
| User Service | Profile management, preferences, user data | Authentication Service, Document Service | User profiles, preferences, settings |
| Care Plan Service | Medical record analysis, care plan generation | Document Service, AI Service | Care plans, medical data, plan versions |
| Services Plan Service | Needs assessment, service matching, cost estimation | Care Plan Service, Provider Service | Service plans, assessments, funding data |
| Provider Service | Provider profiles, availability, matching | User Service, Notification Service | Provider profiles, availability, reviews |
| Analytics Service | Data collection, metrics, reporting | All domain services | Metrics, reports, dashboards |
| Document Service | Document processing, storage, analysis | Blob Storage, AI Service | Documents, analysis results, metadata |
| Notification Service | Alert delivery, preferences, history | User Service, Email/SMS Services | Notification templates, delivery status |

#### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Communication Patterns"
        A[Synchronous Request-Response] --> B[Direct API Calls]
        A --> C[HTTP/REST]
        
        D[Asynchronous Communication] --> E[Event-Driven]
        D --> F[Message Queue]
        
        G[Hybrid Approaches] --> H[Request-Reply Pattern]
        G --> I[Saga Pattern for Transactions]
    end
    
    subgraph "Implementation"
        J[Function Calls] --> K[Within Monolith]
        L[Redis Pub/Sub] --> M[Real-time Events]
        N[Event Log] --> O[Persistent Events]
    end
```

The system employs multiple communication patterns based on specific requirements:

| Pattern | Use Cases | Implementation | Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synchronous | User-initiated actions, UI data loading | Direct function calls within monolith | Potential for cascading failures |
| Event-Driven | Availability updates, notifications | Redis Pub/Sub for real-time events | Eventual consistency challenges |
| Asynchronous | Document processing, report generation | Background jobs with persistent storage | Complexity in tracking status |

#### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

For the MVP phase with a monolithic deployment, traditional service discovery and load balancing are simplified:

- **Service Discovery**: Services are registered in a central service registry within the application
- **Load Balancing**: Application-level load balancing for internal services based on resource utilization

As the system evolves toward microservices, the following strategies will be implemented:

- **Service Discovery**: DNS-based discovery with health checks
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin with health awareness for even distribution

#### Circuit Breaker Patterns

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout period elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success threshold met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failure occurs
    
    note right of Closed
        Normal operation
        Failures counted
    end note
    
    note right of Open
        All requests fail fast
        No external calls made
    end note
    
    note right of HalfOpen
        Limited requests allowed
        Testing if system recovered
    end note
```

Circuit breakers are implemented for critical external service integrations:

| Service Integration | Failure Threshold | Timeout Period | Recovery Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Service | 5 failures in 30 seconds | 60 seconds | Fallback to cached results |
| Payment Processing | 3 failures in 60 seconds | 120 seconds | Manual processing option |
| Email/SMS Service | 10 failures in 60 seconds | 300 seconds | In-app notifications only |
| Calendar Integration | 5 failures in 60 seconds | 180 seconds | Local availability storage |

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

| Operation | Retry Strategy | Fallback Mechanism | Recovery Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document Analysis | Exponential backoff (3 retries) | Manual processing option | Alert operations team |
| Payment Processing | Immediate retry, then 30s, 60s | Alternative payment method | Notification to user |
| Email Delivery | 5min, 15min, 60min delays | In-app notification | Log for manual follow-up |
| Provider Matching | No retry (idempotent operation) | Broader matching criteria | Suggest manual matching |

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

#### Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling Approach

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Scaling Strategy"
        A[Initial Deployment] --> B[Vertical Scaling]
        B --> C[Resource Limits Reached]
        C --> D[Horizontal Scaling]
        
        E[Monolith] --> F[Extract API Routes]
        F --> G[Separate Frontend/Backend]
        G --> H[Extract Microservices]
    end
    
    subgraph "Component Scaling"
        I[Web Tier] --> J[Stateless Horizontal Scaling]
        K[Database Tier] --> L[Vertical Scaling + Read Replicas]
        M[Cache Tier] --> N[Distributed Caching]
    end
```

Revolucare implements a hybrid scaling approach:

| Component | Initial Scaling | Growth Scaling | Scaling Triggers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web Application | Vertical scaling | Horizontal scaling with load balancer | CPU > 70%, Memory > 80% |
| Database | Vertical scaling | Read replicas for query-heavy operations | Query latency > 100ms, CPU > 60% |
| Cache | Single instance | Distributed cache cluster | Cache hit ratio < 80%, Memory > 70% |
| Document Processing | Queue-based processing | Worker pool scaling | Queue depth > 100, Processing time > 30s |

#### Auto-Scaling Triggers and Rules

For the MVP phase, manual scaling is implemented with monitoring alerts. As the system evolves, the following auto-scaling rules will be applied:

| Component | Scale Out Trigger | Scale In Trigger | Cooldown Period | Scaling Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web Servers | CPU > 70% for 3 minutes | CPU < 30% for 10 minutes | 5 minutes | Min: 2, Max: 10 |
| Worker Processes | Queue depth > 100 for 5 minutes | Queue depth < 10 for 15 minutes | 10 minutes | Min: 1, Max: 5 |
| Database | Manual scaling based on performance metrics | N/A | N/A | Based on capacity planning |
| Cache | Memory usage > 70% for 5 minutes | Memory usage < 40% for 15 minutes | 10 minutes | Min: 1, Max: 3 |

#### Resource Allocation Strategy

| Resource Type | Allocation Strategy | Optimization Approach | Monitoring Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | Baseline + burst capacity | Efficient algorithms, caching | Utilization, throttling events |
| Memory | Right-sized with 30% headroom | Memory profiling, leak detection | Usage patterns, garbage collection |
| Storage | Tiered approach based on access patterns | Data lifecycle management | I/O operations, growth rate |
| Network | Bandwidth allocation by service priority | Compression, batching | Throughput, latency, errors |

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Performance Optimization Layers"
        A[Application Layer] --> A1[Code Optimization]
        A[Application Layer] --> A2[Caching Strategy]
        A[Application Layer] --> A3[Asynchronous Processing]

        B[Data Layer] --> B2[Indexing Strategy]
        B[Data Layer] --> B3[Data Partitioning]
        
        C[Infrastructure Layer] --> C1[Resource Allocation]
        C[Infrastructure Layer] --> C2[Load Distribution]
        C[Infrastructure Layer] --> C3[Network Optimization]
    end
```

| Layer | Optimization Techniques | Implementation | Expected Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization | Next.js built-in optimizations | 30-50% faster page loads |
| API | Response caching, pagination, compression | Redis cache, middleware | 40-60% reduced response times |
| Database | Query optimization, indexing, connection pooling | Prisma optimizations, PostgreSQL tuning | 50-70% faster query execution |
| External Services | Batching, parallel processing, caching | Custom integration layer | 30-50% reduced integration times |

#### Capacity Planning Guidelines

| Metric | Current Capacity | Growth Projection | Scaling Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Concurrent Users | 1,000 | 10% monthly growth | Scale at 70% capacity |
| Database Size | 50GB initial | 5GB monthly growth | Vertical scaling at 70% |
| Document Storage | 100GB initial | 10GB monthly growth | Add storage at 80% usage |
| API Requests | 50 req/sec | 15% monthly growth | Scale at 60% capacity |

        H[Cache Layer] --> I[Distributed Cache]
        H --> J[Cache Warming]
    end
```

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

### 6.2.1 SCHEMA DESIGN

#### Entity Relationships

The Revolucare platform uses a relational database model with PostgreSQL to manage complex relationships between users, care plans, services, and providers. The schema is designed to support the core business domains while ensuring data integrity and performance.

```mermaid

    User ||--o{ ProviderProfile : has
    User ||--o{ CaseManagerProfile : has
    User ||--o{ AdminProfile : has

    User ||--o{ Notification : receives
    
    ClientProfile ||--o{ CarePlan : has
    ClientProfile ||--o{ ServicesPlan : has
    ClientProfile ||--o{ NeedsAssessment : undergoes
    
    CarePlan ||--o{ CarePlanGoal : contains

    Booking ||--|| ProviderProfile : assigns
    Booking ||--|| ClientProfile : serves
    
    Document ||--o{ DocumentAnalysis : undergoes
```

#### Data Models and Structures

#### Indexing Strategy

The indexing strategy is designed to optimize the most common query patterns while balancing write performance.

**Primary Indexes**

| Table | Index Type | Columns | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| users | Primary Key | id | Unique identifier lookup |
| users | Unique | email | Email-based authentication |
| client_profiles | Primary Key | id | Unique identifier lookup |
| client_profiles | Foreign Key | user_id | User relationship lookup |
| provider_profiles | Primary Key | id | Unique identifier lookup |
| provider_profiles | Foreign Key | user_id | User relationship lookup |
| care_plans | Primary Key | id | Unique identifier lookup |
| care_plans | Foreign Key | client_id | Client relationship lookup |
| services_plans | Primary Key | id | Unique identifier lookup |
| services_plans | Foreign Key | client_id | Client relationship lookup |

**Secondary Indexes**

| Table | Index Type | Columns | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| users | B-tree | role | Role-based filtering |
| users | B-tree | created_at | Chronological sorting |
| provider_profiles | B-tree | organization_name | Name-based search |
| provider_profiles | GIN | service_types | Service-based filtering |
| service_areas | GiST | location | Geographic proximity search |
| availability | B-tree | (provider_id, start_time) | Availability lookup |
| care_plans | B-tree | (client_id, status) | Status filtering by client |
| services_plans | B-tree | (client_id, status) | Status filtering by client |
| bookings | B-tree | (provider_id, start_time) | Provider schedule lookup |
| bookings | B-tree | (client_id, start_time) | Client appointment lookup |

#### Partitioning Approach

For the MVP phase, horizontal partitioning will be implemented for the following high-volume tables:

| Table | Partition Key | Partition Strategy | Retention Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| availability | date_trunc('month', start_time) | Range partitioning by month | 12 months online, archive older |
| bookings | date_trunc('month', created_at) | Range partitioning by month | 24 months online, archive older |
| notifications | date_trunc('month', created_at) | Range partitioning by month | 6 months online, archive older |
| audit_logs | date_trunc('month', created_at) | Range partitioning by month | 12 months online, archive older |

#### Replication Configuration

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Primary Database"
        PG_Primary[PostgreSQL Primary]
    end
    
    subgraph "Read Replicas"
        PG_Read1[Read Replica 1]
        PG_Read2[Read Replica 2]
    end
    
    subgraph "Standby for Failover"
        PG_Standby[Standby Replica]
    end
    
    PG_Primary -->|Synchronous Replication| PG_Standby
    PG_Primary -->|Asynchronous Replication| PG_Read1
    PG_Primary -->|Asynchronous Replication| PG_Read2
    
    subgraph "Client Applications"
        App[Application Servers]
    end
    
    App -->|Write Operations| PG_Primary
    App -->|Read Operations| PG_Read1
    App -->|Read Operations| PG_Read2
    
    subgraph "Monitoring"
        Monitor[Database Monitoring]
    end
    
    Monitor -->|Health Checks| PG_Primary
    Monitor -->|Health Checks| PG_Standby
    Monitor -->|Health Checks| PG_Read1
    Monitor -->|Health Checks| PG_Read2
```

The replication strategy includes:

1. **Primary Database**: Handles all write operations and critical read operations
2. **Synchronous Standby**: Maintains an up-to-date copy for high availability and failover
3. **Asynchronous Read Replicas**: Handle read-heavy operations to distribute load

#### Backup Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Database Servers"
        PG[PostgreSQL Database]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backup Process"
        Full[Daily Full Backup]
        WAL[Continuous WAL Archiving]
        Inc[Hourly Incremental Backup]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage Locations"
        Local[Local Storage]
        Cloud[Cloud Object Storage]

    end
    
    PG -->|pg_basebackup| Full
    PG -->|pg_receivewal| WAL
    PG -->|pg_dump| Inc
    
    Full -->|Store| Local
    WAL -->|Stream| Local
    Inc -->|Store| Local
    
    Local -->|Replicate| Cloud
    Cloud -->|Archive| OffSite
    
    subgraph "Retention Policy"
        Daily[Daily: 14 days]
        Weekly[Weekly: 8 weeks]
        Monthly[Monthly: 12 months]
        Yearly[Yearly: 7 years]
    end
    
    Cloud --> Daily
    Cloud --> Weekly
    Cloud --> Monthly
    OffSite --> Yearly
```

The backup strategy includes:

1. **Full Backups**: Daily complete database backups
2. **WAL Archiving**: Continuous transaction log archiving for point-in-time recovery
3. **Incremental Backups**: Hourly changes to reduce recovery time
4. **Multi-tier Storage**: Local, cloud, and off-site storage for redundancy

### 6.2.2 DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

Database migrations follow a structured approach to ensure consistency and reliability:

| Migration Phase | Tools | Validation Steps | Rollback Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schema Design | Prisma Schema | Entity relationship validation | Version control for schema files |
| Migration Generation | Prisma Migrate | Automated diff detection | Generated up/down migrations |
| Testing | Jest, Database Sandbox | Test against sample data | Isolated test environment |
| Deployment | CI/CD Pipeline | Schema validation checks | Automated rollback on failure |

**Migration Workflow**:

1. Developers create schema changes in development environment
2. Prisma Migrate generates migration files
3. Automated tests validate migrations against test data
4. CI/CD pipeline applies migrations in staging environment
5. After approval, migrations are applied to production
6. Monitoring for any post-migration issues

#### Versioning Strategy

Database schema versioning follows semantic versioning principles:

| Version Component | Meaning | Example Changes | Migration Approach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Major Version | Breaking schema changes | Table removal, column type changes | Scheduled maintenance window |
| Minor Version | Non-breaking additions | New tables, new columns | Zero-downtime migration |
| Patch Version | Data fixes, index changes | Index optimization, data correction | Background migration |

Each migration is tracked with:
- Unique identifier
- Timestamp
- Author
- Description
- Dependencies
- Validation tests

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archive Retention | Archival Method | Retrieval Process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Data | Indefinite | 7 years after deletion | Encrypted object storage | Admin-initiated restore |
| Care Plans | 3 years after last update | 7 years | Compressed JSON in object storage | Client or admin request |
| Service Records | 2 years after completion | 7 years | Compressed JSON in object storage | Client or admin request |
| Availability Data | 1 year | None (deleted) | N/A | N/A |
| Audit Logs | 1 year | 7 years | Compressed files in cold storage | Legal or compliance request |

**Connection Management Strategy**:

1. **Dynamic Sizing**: Adjust pool size based on load
2. **Health Checking**: Regular validation of pooled connections
3. **Connection Reuse**: Maximize connection utilization
4. **Timeout Management**: Prevent connection leaks

#### Read/Write Splitting

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Application Layer"
        App[Application Servers]
    end
    
    subgraph "Database Router"
        Router[Connection Router]

| Provider Search | Read Replica | Eventually consistent | Fallback to primary |
| Critical Reads | Primary | Immediate consistency | No fallback needed |
| Analytics Queries | Read Replica | Eventually consistent | Queue for later processing |

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Process Type | Batch Size | Frequency | Processing Window | Monitoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Import | 1,000 records | As needed | Off-peak hours | Completion time, error rate |
| Report Generation | 50 reports | Daily | 1:00 AM - 5:00 AM | Resource utilization, completion time |
| Notification Delivery | 500 notifications | Every 15 minutes | 24/7 | Delivery rate, latency |
| Data Archiving | 10,000 records | Weekly | Weekends | Completion time, verification |

**Batch Processing Optimizations**:

1. **Chunking**: Break large operations into manageable chunks
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple workers for independent operations
3. **Idempotency**: Safe retry mechanisms for failed operations
4. **Progress Tracking**: Checkpointing for long-running processes

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

The Revolucare platform requires extensive integration with external systems and services to deliver its core functionality. This section outlines the integration architecture that enables seamless communication between Revolucare and these external systems.

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Security Measures | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS | All API communications | TLS 1.3, HSTS | Enforced for all endpoints |
| WebSockets | Real-time availability updates | TLS, token authentication | Provider availability tracking |
| REST | Primary API architecture | JWT authentication | Standard HTTP methods |
| Webhooks | Event notifications | HMAC signature verification | External service callbacks |

The API design follows REST principles with resource-oriented endpoints. All communications use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 to ensure data security during transit. WebSockets are employed for real-time features like availability updates, while webhooks enable asynchronous event notifications from external services.

#### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Cases | Token Lifetime | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JWT | API authentication | 15 minutes (access), 7 days (refresh) | NextAuth.js with HTTP-only cookies |
| OAuth 2.0 | Third-party integrations | Varies by provider | Social login, calendar integration |
| API Keys | External service access | Long-lived | AI services, payment processing |
| HMAC Signatures | Webhook verification | Per-request | Stripe webhooks, calendar notifications |

Authentication is primarily handled through JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks. OAuth 2.0 is used for integrating with third-party services like Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph. API keys are used for server-to-server communication with external services.

#### Authorization Framework

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Request] --> B[Authentication]
    B --> C{Valid Token?}
    C -->|No| D[401 Unauthorized]
    C -->|Yes| E[Extract Claims]
    E --> F[Role-Based Access Control]
    F --> G{Has Permission?}
    G -->|No| H[403 Forbidden]
    G -->|Yes| I[Resource-Level Authorization]
    I --> J{Resource Access?}
    J -->|No| K[403 Forbidden]
    J -->|Yes| L[Process Request]
```

The authorization framework implements multiple layers:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Permissions based on user role (client, provider, case manager, administrator)
2. **Resource-Level Authorization**: Access control based on resource ownership and relationships
3. **Attribute-Based Policies**: Fine-grained control based on request attributes and context
4. **Scoped Tokens**: OAuth tokens with specific scopes for third-party integrations

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| API Category | Rate Limit | Burst Allowance | Enforcement Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public Endpoints | 60 requests/minute | 10 additional requests | IP-based |
| Authenticated Endpoints | 300 requests/minute | 30 additional requests | User-based |
| Write Operations | 100 requests/minute | 20 additional requests | User-based |
| AI Processing | 30 requests/minute | 5 additional requests | User-based |

Rate limiting is implemented using a token bucket algorithm with Redis for distributed rate limit tracking. The system provides:

- Graduated response (warning headers before rejection)
- Custom rate limits for specific endpoints
- Rate limit increase for premium users
- Automatic throttling during high system load

#### Versioning Approach

| Versioning Component | Strategy | Example | Backward Compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Version | URI path prefix | `/api/v1/users` | Major versions only |
| Resource Versions | ETag headers | `ETag: "a1b2c3"` | All changes |
| Schema Evolution | Additive changes | Add optional fields | Maintained |
| Deprecation | Sunset headers | `Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2023` | 6-month notice |

The API versioning strategy follows these principles:

1. Major version changes in URI path for breaking changes
2. Content negotiation with `Accept` headers for minor variations
3. Additive-only changes within a version (add fields, never remove)
4. Deprecation notices with timeline before removing functionality

#### Documentation Standards

| Documentation Type | Tool/Format | Audience | Update Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Reference | OpenAPI 3.0 | Developers | With each release |
| Integration Guides | Markdown | Implementation teams | Monthly |
| Code Examples | Multiple languages | Developers | With feature changes |
| Postman Collection | Postman | API consumers | With each release |

API documentation is generated from OpenAPI specifications and includes:

- Interactive API explorer
- Request/response examples
- Authentication instructions
- Error code reference
- Rate limit information
- Webhook payload schemas

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Event Sources"
        A1[User Actions]
        A2[System Operations]
        A3[External Services]
    end
    
    subgraph "Event Processing"
        B1[Event Capture]
        B2[Event Validation]
        B3[Event Enrichment]
        B4[Event Routing]
    end
    
    subgraph "Event Consumers"
        C1[Real-time Processors]
        C2[Analytics Pipeline]
        C3[Notification Service]
        C4[Audit System]
    end
    
    A1 --> B1
    A2 --> B1
    A3 --> B1
    
    B1 --> B2
    B2 --> B3
    B3 --> B4
    
    B4 --> C1
    B4 --> C2
    B4 --> C3
    B4 --> C4
```

The event processing architecture follows these patterns:

1. **Event Sourcing**: Critical business events are stored as an immutable log
2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separate write and read operations
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling between services through events
4. **Publish-Subscribe**: Multiple consumers can subscribe to event types

#### Message Queue Architecture

| Queue Type | Use Cases | Implementation | Delivery Guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task Queue | Document processing, report generation | Redis | At-least-once |
| Event Bus | System events, notifications | Redis Pub/Sub | Best-effort |
| Dead Letter Queue | Failed message handling | Redis | Guaranteed storage |
| Priority Queue | Critical operations | Redis | Priority-based |

The message queue architecture provides:

- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
- Load leveling during traffic spikes
- Work distribution across multiple processors
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queues for failed messages

#### Stream Processing Design

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Event Stream] --> B[Stream Processor]
    B --> C[State Store]
    B --> D[Processed Events]
    
    E[Real-time Analytics] --> B
    F[Anomaly Detection] --> B
    G[Event Correlation] --> B
    
    D --> H[Notification Triggers]
    D --> I[Dashboard Updates]
    D --> J[Audit Records]
```

Stream processing is used for:

1. **Real-time Analytics**: Processing event streams for dashboard updates
2. **Availability Updates**: Real-time tracking of provider availability changes
3. **Notification Triggers**: Generating alerts based on event patterns
4. **Audit Trail**: Recording system activity for compliance

#### Batch Processing Flows

| Batch Process | Frequency | Processing Window | Retry Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Report Generation | Daily | 1:00 AM - 5:00 AM | 3 attempts, 30-min intervals |
| Data Aggregation | Hourly | 5 minutes past hour | 5 attempts, 5-min intervals |
| Document Analysis | As needed | 24/7 with rate limiting | 3 attempts, exponential backoff |
| Data Export | Weekly | Weekends | Manual intervention after failure |

Batch processing is implemented for operations that:

- Process large volumes of data
- Generate reports and analytics
- Perform system maintenance
- Execute scheduled tasks

#### Error Handling Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Message Processing] --> B{Processing Error?}
    B -->|No| C[Success Path]
    B -->|Yes| D{Error Type}
    
    D -->|Transient| E[Retry with Backoff]
    E --> F{Retry Limit Reached?}
    F -->|No| A
    F -->|Yes| G[Dead Letter Queue]
    
    D -->|Validation| H[Reject Message]
    H --> I[Error Notification]
    
    D -->|System| J[Alert Operations]
    J --> K[Circuit Breaker]
    
    G --> L[Error Analysis]
    L --> M{Recoverable?}
    M -->|Yes| N[Fix and Reprocess]
    N --> A
    M -->|No| O[Permanent Failure Record]
```

The error handling strategy includes:

1. **Error Classification**: Categorizing errors as transient, validation, or system
2. **Retry Policies**: Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
3. **Dead Letter Queues**: Storage for messages that cannot be processed
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Preventing cascading failures during system issues
5. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Notification of error patterns and thresholds

### 6.3.3 EXTERNAL SYSTEMS

#### Third-Party Integration Patterns

| Integration Pattern | External Systems | Implementation | Fallback Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct API Integration | OpenAI, Azure Form Recognizer | REST API clients | Graceful degradation |
| OAuth-based Integration | Google Calendar, Microsoft Graph | OAuth 2.0 flow | Local calendar storage |
| Webhook Consumers | Stripe, SendGrid | Signature verification | Polling as backup |
| SDK Integration | Twilio, Google Maps | Official client libraries | Feature disablement |

The system employs multiple integration patterns based on the requirements of each external service:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Standardized interfaces for different external services
2. **Facade Pattern**: Simplified interfaces for complex external systems
3. **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Protecting core domain from external system concepts
4. **Gateway Pattern**: Unified access point for external services

#### Legacy System Interfaces

| Legacy System | Integration Method | Data Transformation | Synchronization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EHR Systems | HL7 FHIR API | JSON transformation | Scheduled batch |
| Care Management Systems | REST API | Field mapping | Event-driven |
| Billing Systems | SFTP file exchange | CSV/XML parsing | Daily batch |
| Provider Directories | REST API | Schema normalization | Weekly refresh |

Integration with legacy systems follows these principles:

1. **Minimal Coupling**: Loose integration to reduce dependencies
2. **Data Transformation**: Converting between legacy and modern formats
3. **Idempotent Operations**: Safe retry mechanisms for reliability
4. **Audit Trail**: Tracking all data exchanges for troubleshooting

#### API Gateway Configuration

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Client Applications"
        A[Web Application]
        B[Mobile Web]
        C[Future Native Apps]
    end
    
    subgraph "API Gateway"
        D[Authentication]
        E[Rate Limiting]
        F[Request Validation]
        G[Response Transformation]
        H[Logging & Monitoring]
    end
    
    subgraph "Internal Services"
        I[User Service]
        J[Care Plan Service]
        K[Provider Service]
        L[Analytics Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "External Services"
        M[AI Services]
        N[Payment Services]
        O[Communication Services]
        P[Calendar Services]
    end
    
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> H
    
    H --> I

    H --> K
    H --> L
    
    J --> M
    K --> P
    L --> M
    I --> O
    J --> N
```

The API gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests and provides:

1. **Request Routing**: Directing requests to appropriate services
2. **Authentication**: Validating user identity and permissions
3. **Rate Limiting**: Protecting services from excessive traffic
4. **Request Transformation**: Adapting client requests for internal services
5. **Response Transformation**: Formatting responses for clients
6. **Monitoring**: Tracking API usage and performance

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### 6.4.1 AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

The Revolucare platform implements a comprehensive authentication framework to ensure secure access while maintaining a seamless user experience across all roles.

#### Identity Management

| Component | Implementation | Purpose | Security Controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Registration | Email verification, captcha | Prevent automated registrations | Rate limiting, fraud detection |
| Identity Verification | Role-specific verification | Validate provider credentials | Document verification, background checks |
| Account Recovery | Multi-channel verification | Secure account recovery | Cooling periods, notification alerts |
| Identity Federation | OAuth 2.0 integration | Support social/enterprise login | Strict callback validation |

The identity management system maintains separation between authentication identities and user profiles, allowing for flexible identity verification workflows based on user role while maintaining a consistent authentication experience.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Login Request] --> B[Primary Authentication]
    B --> C{MFA Required?}
    C -->|No| D[Access Granted]
    C -->|Yes| E[Generate MFA Challenge]
    E --> F[Send Challenge]
    F --> G{Challenge Type}
    G -->|SMS| H[Send SMS Code]
    G -->|Email| I[Send Email Code]
    G -->|Authenticator App| J[Generate TOTP]
    H --> K[Verify Response]
    I --> K
    J --> K
    K --> L{Valid Response?}
    L -->|Yes| D
    L -->|No| M[Increment Failure Count]
    M --> N{Max Attempts?}
    N -->|No| E
    N -->|Yes| O[Lock Account]
    O --> P[Notify User]
```

| MFA Method | User Roles | Implementation | Fallback Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Email Code | All users | Time-limited 6-digit code | Security questions |
| SMS Code | All users | Time-limited 6-digit code | Email verification |
| Authenticator App | Administrators, Case Managers | TOTP (RFC 6238) | Backup codes |
| Security Keys | Administrators | WebAuthn/FIDO2 | Authenticator app |

MFA is required for:
- Administrator accounts (always)
- Case manager accounts (always)
- Provider accounts (configurable)
- Client accounts (optional, recommended)
- Any account accessing PHI/PII
- Suspicious login attempts (risk-based)

#### Session Management

| Session Control | Implementation | Purpose | Security Measure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session Timeout | 30 minutes (active), 8 hours (refresh) | Limit exposure window | Automatic logout |
| Concurrent Sessions | Limited to 3 per user | Prevent credential sharing | Session inventory for users |
| Session Validation | JWT with secure claims | Prevent tampering | Signature verification |
| Session Revocation | Centralized token blacklist | Immediate logout capability | Redis-backed revocation |

The session management system implements:
- Secure, HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Sliding expiration for active users
- Absolute maximum session duration
- Device fingerprinting for suspicious activity detection
- Automatic session termination upon password change

#### Token Handling

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client as Client App
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Auth Service
    participant Redis as Token Store
    
    User->>Client: Login credentials
    Client->>API: Authentication request
    API->>Auth: Validate credentials
    
    Auth->>Auth: Verify credentials
    Auth->>Redis: Store refresh token
    Auth->>API: Return tokens
    
    API->>Client: Access token (short-lived)<br>Refresh token (HTTP-only cookie)
    
    Note over Client,API: Later: Access token expires
    
    Client->>API: Request with expired token
    API->>Client: 401 Unauthorized
    Client->>API: Token refresh request with refresh token
    API->>Auth: Validate refresh token
    Auth->>Redis: Verify token is valid
    Auth->>Redis: Invalidate old refresh token
    Auth->>Redis: Store new refresh token
    Auth->>API: Return new tokens
    API->>Client: New access token<br>New refresh token (HTTP-only cookie)
```

| Token Type | Lifetime | Storage Location | Cryptographic Controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access Token | 15 minutes | Memory (client-side) | JWT, RS256 signature |
| Refresh Token | 7 days | HTTP-only, secure cookie | Opaque token, server-side validation |
| API Keys | 90 days (rotating) | Secure vault | Scoped permissions, IP restrictions |
| Verification Tokens | 24 hours | Database (hashed) | One-time use, time-limited |

The token system implements:
- Token rotation on refresh
- Strict validation of token claims
- Audience and issuer validation
- Automatic token revocation on suspicious activity
- Rate limiting for token operations

#### Password Policies

| Policy Element | Requirement | Enforcement | Exception Process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum Length | 12 characters | Registration, password change | None |
| Complexity | 3 of 4 character types | Client and server validation | None |
| History | No reuse of last 10 passwords | Server-side validation | None |
| Maximum Age | 90 days | Expiration notification | Administrative override |
| Account Lockout | 5 failed attempts | Temporary lockout (30 minutes) | Support ticket |

Additional password security measures:
- Argon2id password hashing with appropriate work factors
- Secure password reset workflow with expiring tokens

| Low (P4) | Ticket queue | 24 hours | None |

The alert routing system ensures:
- Alerts are sent to the appropriate team based on the affected service
- Alert severity determines notification urgency and channel
- Context-rich alerts with direct links to dashboards and logs
- Automatic escalation if acknowledgment or resolution times are exceeded
- Feedback loop for alert quality improvement

#### Escalation Procedures

```mermaid
